Just stepped out of Ad Vitam and I’m just... whoa. The way they pulled that ending off—wasn't expecting it at all. Or the beginning. Or the middle. Pretty much had no clue what was happening half the time. Which is wild because I’m pretty sure I still liked it? Someone keeps killing the immortals and it’s like they just hit a big pause button on death, you get me? Don't even mention the popcorn. It's all over me. Crunching underfoot, pretty sure some kernels made it into a wormhole to my pants pocket. 

> So there's this detective, right? And he’s constantly walking like he's lost his favorite pen and his thoughts are a page of scribbles out of a teenager's diary. All gloom and glitter and, boy, that theater seat was not made for long sittings. My back—might as well be a pretzel right now. But the trains of thought it kicks up. Man I think I need a vacation, or a neck rub, or ice... Maybe you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   without a chair from the Middle Ages on your spine?

The sound. So loud, like an explosion of metal rain, definitely felt it bouncing around my skull. Imagine if Blade Runner and Inception had a baby, and that baby grew up 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 old 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 noir with a bottle of Cherry Coke and like three laptops in the dark. Then maybe that doesn’t even sum it up. 

Scenes flash. Flickering lights, immortals crying. Life's a Ferris wheel just spinning. And that one scene—like a washing machine of emotions. You ever try making sense of people drowning in their own eternal youth? Their lives, a looping cassette tape. Yeah, it’s like there’s a never-ending birt𝘏𝘋ay party, but with more existential dread.

There was this point where I think I understood. Then nope, lost it like a helium balloon. Oh, Laurence looked like ten miles of tough road, soul like a wrinkled leather jacket. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? If I can count all the popcorn stains gone, maybe. But I also think I flipped over in my seat when the resolution hit. Something so twisted felt familiar but... new.

And then there's a giraffe or not, metaphorical but... eh. Too much to unpack without coffee and a diagram.

Ah, all this text. Anyway! Couldn’t help recall — did you ask if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 this universe of a  ? Because yeah, um, definitely.

Fell into this vortex of pixels, time to get some normal oxygen.
